This is a basic demonstration of an application for scouting and tracking fencers at tournaments.
To run it, make sure there is an appropriate JVM installed on your machine, then double click
the '.jar' file.
When run, it produces 3 reports:
The first report pulls data from the 'fencer' table to display athletes' names, club, handedness,
and rating.  The athletes displayed are all from the same event, which the app determines by
querying the 'tournament_match' table to see which athletes participated.
The second report pulls data from 'tournament_match' to create a list of matches from the event
used in report 1.  It combines data from the 'fencer' and 'referee' tables to include athlete and
referee names, as well as round number and final scores from 'tournament_match'.
The third report requires input from the user.
First, input either the first or last name of the athlete you want to look up and press 'enter'.
The first few letters are sufficient.
The app will then display a list of possible matches.  Enter the number to the left of the
athlete's name to display a list of all notes made on that athlete.
The app then exits.
